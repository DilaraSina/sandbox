========================

### Reference
K. Desingh, K. M. Krishna, D. Rajan and C. V. Jawahar - Depth Really Matters: Improving Visual Salient Region Detection with Depth, BMVC, 2013

### Notes
- The code is an impletation of Section.3 of the reference paper, SVM fusion for RGB-D saliency is not evolved
- Instead of using region growing cluster method, another RGB-D segmentation method is also available, please check *RGBD-Segmenter* folder for detail.
